🎨 Frontend TODO (Design with Dummy Data First)
1. Setup & Base
✅ Init React project
✅ Add TailwindCSS

2. Reusable Components (Atomic UI)
❌ Button (variants: primary, secondary, outline, disabled, loading)
❌ Input (text, password, email, search with icon)
❌ Select/Dropdown
❌ Modal/Dialog (e.g., login popup, confirmation)
❌ Card (for products, media, orders)
❌ Badge/Tag (for categories, statuses)

4. Navigation & Global Stuff
